# PHP-Registration-System

A PHP employee registration system. 

I used (XAMPP)[https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html] software package to host the application. 

## Installation

1. run the `sql_script.sql` to create database for the registration system
2. once the database is up and running, host the `index.php` in your local server using XAMPP
3. The application should allow for basic CRUD operations if server and database are hosted properly
